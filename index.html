                    <p>This project demonstrates a simple home automation system that allows the user to control it with
                        a wireless device such as a WI-FI or Bluetooth enabled mobile phone. A desktop PC is used to run
                        the server software. The system allows the user to control each of the lights and fans
                        individually. It can automatically turn off the main lights and turn on a night lamp at a
                        specified time. By measuring the signal strength, it can detect when the user enters a room and
                        automatically turn on the light and fans, and then automatically turn them off when the user
                        leaves the room.

                        I made this project during my internship in TCS organisation. It was a 'Self Check-in app'. I
                        made this project in android studio. In this project the user was able to login in to the app
                        and booked hotel rooms and did self check-in and check-out. The purpose of this project was to
                        make the process of check-in and check-out smooth and easy for the user.

                        <p>Zensar-Employbility Skill Development Programme was held in my college and it was done in
                            sessions. It was a one month two days training programme in which they covered various
                            topics such as SQL (PL/SQL),JAVA CORE, AI/ML (this was not covered), Life-skills, Manual
                            Testing, Behavioural-skills etc. Unfortunately, due to the coronavirus pandemic AI/ML was
                            not covered and so the manual testing. We had to stop the training
                            in between. In this training we were taught about how people work on an industry level and
                            how things work in a corporate business.

                            and queries.
                            My project topic was 'Hotel Self-Check-in App'. This was a very new topic for me because I
                            never worked on app-development, I got to learn new things and was able to implement the
